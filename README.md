## What is it for ?
It's simple powershell script, depndecy free! That manage and automate installing your packages,
so you can even keep it somewhere in cloud. All you need to have is Powershell.

## How can I provide it ?
Simply you can provide link to any txt file or read from same location as this
script.

## How should my file looks like ?
Right now simply list all your programs each in a new line. Possibly in the
future we going to develop some json-like format to support more bespoke
provisioning of your enviroment.  


#TODO :
