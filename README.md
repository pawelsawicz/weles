## What is it for ?
It's light-weight provisioning tool, dependency free!
That manage and automate installing your packages based on chocolatey.
Everywhere on your PC, VMs or container. All you need to have is Powershell.

## How can I provide my config ?
Simply you can provide link to any txt file on the internet or read config file from same location as this
script.

## How should my file looks like ?
Right now it's just simply list of all your programs each program in a new line. Example in [fakeProvisioning](fakeProvisioning.txt)
Possibly in the future we going to develop some json-like format to support more bespoke
provisioning of your enviroment.
